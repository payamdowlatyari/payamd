              There are many reasons to study psychology, from career prospects to personal interest. Psychology is a
              fascinating area of study.

              Psychology is the scientific study of the mind and behavior, according to the American Psychological
              Association. Psychology is a multifaceted discipline and includes many sub-fields of study such areas as
              human development, sports, health, clinical, social behavior and cognitive processes. <br><br>

              Development,

              I think philosophy is an activity of mind. Philosophy is what happens when you start thinking for
              yourself. It is a way of thinking about certain sorts
              of question. I like philosophy because it gives me power to have a better understanding of reality and
              helps me to learn how to ask the right questions and how to criticize wrong beliefs.
              <br><br>
              Once one frees oneself from the habits of received belief, those that one
              just happens to have acquired even about basic issues, and really starts to think about what one ought to
              believe, judged by reason (argument) and evidence, then one has started to do philosophy.

              A fascinating exploration of how computer algorithms can be applied to our everyday lives, helping to
              solve common decision-making problems and illuminate the workings of the human mind.
              <br><br><br><strong>My Review:</strong>
              <br>
              Decision-making is one of the most critical functions of our mind. In this book, the authors clearly show
              how peoples' minds are programmed. The whole idea of algorithm design is about how our minds process and
              the steps we use to overcome challenges. Psychology explains how humans' minds operate when it comes to
              tasks that are difficult but common. We need to solve a problem once by finding the proper steps, remember
              them, and use them any time we face the same or similar problems. This idea is how computers work.
              Computers are programmed to make our life easier by completing tasks faster as a result of the combination
              of the power of the mind and the functionality of microprocessors that use with multiple levels of
              software. Authors go over the most crucial concepts of data structures and algorithms like searching,
              sorting, optimizing, graphs, etc., and show how such ideas were born.
              Although the literature is fairly simple, smooth, and does not include too many technical words and
              phrases, its concepts can be somehow difficult for readers with no or limited background in computer
              science and mathematics.

              Humans of New York is a photoblog and book of street portraits and interviews collected on the streets of
              New York City.
              <br> <br><br><strong>My Review:</strong> <br>
              Amazing book for people who are interested in photography, especially street photography, and also the
              ones
              who
              like to read true stories about individuals with all the similarities and differences. New York City is
              the best location for street photography. It is one of the most diverse cities in the world with people
              from different cultures, social statuses, and nationalities.
              This book is an album full of colorful, exceptional, and artistic photos.
              Each person has a unique story to tell. Each photo captures a moment of that person's life, showing a
              specific feeling. Each photograph is associated with a caption and has a little story about the subject.
              Captions give you more, less, or no information about it.
              One of the most impactful lessons I learned from the author of this book is there is nothing better than
              humans for photography.

              The Six Pillars of Self-Esteem is a psychology book written by Dr. Nathaniel Branden. Dr. Branden is known
              as the "father" of the Self-Esteem movement and this book is his most popular work.
              <br> <br><br> <br> <strong>My Review:</strong> <br>
              Everybody should read this book, especially people with low self-esteem. Most psychological disorders such
              as depression, anxiety, and anger come from a lack of self-esteem. During a person's mental development,
              most babies between the age of one and three years old received millions of signals from other people
              regarding their weaknesses. Because children make mistakes and others correct them, they think they are
              bad. In the next stages of development, as what Piage introduced as the preoperational, concrete, and
              formal operational stages, the bad feeling of a child must be recovered by positive messages from parents,
              friends, and the educational system. Otherwise, the person could suffer from a low-esteem.
              In this book, Dr. Brandon provides a scientific and empirical method for building one's self-esteem as an
              adult.

              <strong>Abstract: </strong>
              The research community on the study and design of systems for personal informatics has grown over the past
              decade. To take stock of what the topics the field has studied and methods the field has used, we map and
              label
              523 publications from ACM's library, IEEE Xplore, and PubMed. We surface that the literature has focused
              on
              studying and designing for health and wellness domains, an emphasis on understanding and overcoming
              barriers
              to
              data collection and reflection, and progressively fewer contributions involving artifacts being made. Our
              mapping review suggests directions future research could explore, such as identifying and resolving
              barriers
              to
              tracking stages beyond collection and reflection, engaging more with domain experts, and further

                Infrastructure</a>

            <p class="job-description">

              In this paper I tried to explain the importance of infrastructure in the 21st century and answer
              the following questions: <br>
              What makes up infrastructure? <br> What is its purpose? <br> Why is it essential? <br> How does it evolve
              and
              change?
              <br>
              As technology has improved and the internet becomes part of our lives, the notion of infrastructure has
              been generalized to the world of information technology and, as a result, IT infrastructure was
              introduced.
              In the 21st century, many people take advantage of using IT infrastructure, without consciously being
              aware of its existence, and the significance of its role in shaping society. - <a

                Technology</a>
            </h3>
            <p class="job-description">
              The concept of technology has been used broadly and repeatedly. Society, on the other hand, has its own
              meaning especially when is used in relation with effects of technology. In this article, I addressed some
              of these problems: <br>
              Is technology an abstract concept? <br>What about society? <br>Do technology and society exist in two
              separate
              worlds?<br> Does technology control our lives directly? <br>

              Technology exists as a medium that has been designed, created, shaped, evolved and more importantly
              adapted by society throughout history. Society itself is an essential factor in terms of its adaption with
              technology and the extent it is impacted by technological innovations. In fact, as society creates
              technology, technology can be used by people to reshape civilization.- <a
