            <p class="job-description">
              Today, I was listening to Radio Hamrah when a young woman called to ask about her marriage, and how her
              partner insisted on a prenup. For those who don't know, a prenuptial agreement, commonly referred to as a
              prenup, is a written contract you and your spouse enter into before getting legally married. It details
              exactly what happens to finances and assets during your marriage and, of course, in
              the event of divorce.
              Although in some cases, a prenup can help, most of the time can be destructive. The funny thing is that
              those people don't understand that by marrying someone they share their life with someone, their children,
              and their moments. All the moments that could potentially hurt them. The question is "Why do you trust to
              share your life with someone, while
              you cannot share your property with them?"
              We as humans, like other animals have needs that should be satisfied, especially as Mazlo pointed out, our
              physiological needs are essential for our being. The second level is related to security and safety.
              If you satisfied those needs you can go to upper levels like love and belongings, self-esteem, and so on.
              Finally, you get to the point that
              satisfying the need is not essential for being but it improves the state of your well-being or becoming.
              Only the first level is about owning things, and you can satisfy your security need by owning more
              material. Self-actualization is the highest level that you and only you are worth. You think about
              yourself as something far more valuable than materials like your house, car, etc. We can simply understand
              that the person who does not pass the second level can not be in a state that can love and be loved.
              Although many of them do not agree with that. However, if you cannot trust someone with your money, your
              marriage is not at the third level and about love. You see your partner as an object to become more secure
              by having them. Such people have very low self-esteem. They don't love themselves and cannot believe that
              someone can love them because, in their point of view, they are worthless. Nobody. Nothing. Therefore, if
              someone comes close to them, it must be about what they own. <br><br>

            </h3>
            <p class="job-description">
              Since the summer of 2015, when I moved to California from Europe, I have moved into different homes
              several times. Almost every year, I had to change my place, and although I didn't own so much stuff, I was
              stressed out each time that I was supposed to move to a different house. I had to spend a lot of my time
              packing my thing and being worried about the big moving day.
              In my last move from Irvine to Sacramento, I decided to keep the things I need and get rid of the extra
              and unnecessary items. Later I became interested in learning about minimalism philosophy and lifestyle.
              As a minimalist, I can say I am at the starting point of my journey to
              live a simpler and happier life.
              So, what is minimalism anyway?
              There is no right or wrong answer to this question. Everyone has own interpretation of this concept.
              However, I define minimalism such that as a minimalist,
              I am removing the distraction of excess possessions so I can focus more on those things that matter most.
              Minimalism is all about freedom.
              Minimalism isn't an end point.
              It's a constant process of editing, revisiting,
              editing some more. <br><br>

            <p class="job-description">
              Economics is the science that concerns itself with economies. An economy is the large set of inter-related
              production, consumption, and exchange activities that aid in determining how scarce resources are
              allocated.
              Economics is a social science concerned with the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and
              services. It studies how individuals, businesses, governments, and nations make choices about how to
              allocate resources.
              <br><br>
              I believe everyone should be familiar with the basics of economics in the modern societies. I like
              studying
              economics because this knowledge gives you the power to understand how humans or societies deal with each
              other
              over having access and using the scare resources.

              photographic film.

              The Six Pillars of Self-Esteem is a psychology book written by Dr. Nathaniel Branden. Dr. Branden is known
              as the "father" of the Self-Esteem movement and this book is his most popular work.
              <br> <br><br> <br> <strong>My Review:</strong> <br>
              Everybody should read this book, especially people with low self-esteem. Most psychological disorders such
              as depression, anxiety, and anger come from a lack of self-esteem. During a person's mental development,
              most babies between the age of one and three years old received millions of signals from other people
              regarding their weaknesses. Because children make mistakes and others correct them, they think they are
              bad. In the next stages of development, as what Piage introduced as the preoperational, concrete, and
              formal operational stages, the bad feeling of a child must be recovered by positive messages from parents,
              friends, and the educational system. Otherwise, the person could suffer from a low-esteem.
              In this book, Dr. Brandon provides a scientific and empirical method for building one's self-esteem as an
              adult.

              A fascinating exploration of how computer algorithms can be applied to our everyday lives, helping to
              solve common decision-making problems and illuminate the workings of the human mind.
              <br><br><br><strong>My Review:</strong>
              <br>
              Decision-making is one of the most critical functions of our mind. In this book, the authors clearly show
              how peoples' minds are programmed. The whole idea of algorithm design is about how our minds process and
              the steps we use to overcome challenges. Psychology explains how humans' minds operate when it comes to
              tasks that are difficult but common. We need to solve a problem once by finding the proper steps, remember
              them, and use them any time we face the same or similar problems. This idea is how computers work.
              Computers are programmed to make our life easier by completing tasks faster as a result of the combination
              of the power of the mind and the functionality of microprocessors that use with multiple levels of
              software. Authors go over the most crucial concepts of data structures and algorithms like searching,
              sorting, optimizing, graphs, etc., and show how such ideas were born.
              Although the literature is fairly simple, smooth, and does not include too many technical words and
              phrases, its concepts can be somehow difficult for readers with no or limited background in computer
              science and mathematics.

              A guide leads two men through an area known as the Zone to find a room that grants wishes.
              <br>
              This masterpiece is one of the finest movies of all time about life and philosophy of human existence.
              Three men look for some meaning in a strange and dangerous part of the world.
              A writer and a professor without knowing
              each other join the third man, the Stalker, who seems like a loser but know something they don't.
              They follow him to find what they missed in life. Stalker spent all his life and risk everything to get to
              that point. His wife and child are two other interesting characters who look even stranger than Stalker.
              The conversation between these three in the journey makes up the story and artistic shots

              <strong>Abstract: </strong>
              The research community on the study and design of systems for personal informatics has grown over the past
              decade. To take stock of what the topics the field has studied and methods the field has used, we map and
              label
              523 publications from ACM's library, IEEE Xplore, and PubMed. We surface that the literature has focused
              on
              studying and designing for health and wellness domains, an emphasis on understanding and overcoming
              barriers
              to
              data collection and reflection, and progressively fewer contributions involving artifacts being made. Our
              mapping review suggests directions future research could explore, such as identifying and resolving
              barriers
              to
              tracking stages beyond collection and reflection, engaging more with domain experts, and further
              discussing
              the
              privacy and ethical concerns around tracked data.

                Infrastructure</a>
            </h3>
            <p class="job-description">
              In this paper I tried to explain the importance of infrastructure in the 21st century and answer
              the following questions: <br>
              What makes up infrastructure? <br> What is its purpose? <br> Why is it essential? <br> How does it evolve
              and
              change?
              <br>
              As technology has improved and the internet becomes part of our lives, the notion of infrastructure has
              been generalized to the world of information technology and, as a result, IT infrastructure was
              introduced.
              In the 21st century, many people take advantage of using IT infrastructure, without consciously being
              aware of its existence, and the significance of its role in shaping society. - <a
