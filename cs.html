          <p class="job-description">
            Asymptotic notations are the mathematical notations used to describe the running time of an algorithm when
            the input tends towards a particular value or a limiting value.<br>
            There are mainly three asymptotic notations:<br>
            Big-O notation: represents the upper bound of the running time of an algorithm. Thus, it gives the
            worst-case complexity of an algorithm. <br>
            Omega notation: represents the lower bound of the running time of an algorithm. Thus, it provides the best
            case complexity of an algorithm. <br>
            Theta notation: encloses the function from above and below. Since it represents the upper and the lower
            bound of the running time of an algorithm, it is used for analyzing the average-case complexity of an
            algorithm.

            Such an arrangement is called Last In First Out - the last item that is the first item to go out.<br>

            Queue follows the First In First Out (FIFO) rule - the item that goes in first is the item that comes out

            In programming terms, putting items in the queue is called enqueue, and removing items from the queue is
            called dequeue.<br>

            Responsive web design is an approach to web design that makes web pages render well on a variety of devices
            and window or screen sizes.<br>
            The practice consists of a mix of flexible grids and layouts, images and an intelligent use of CSS media
            queries. <br> As the user switches from their laptop to iPad, the website should automatically switch to
            accommodate for resolution, image size and scripting abilities. <br>
            responsive Web design is not only about adjustable screen resolutions and automatically resizable images,
            but rather about a whole new way of thinking about design.

            Web-based APIs are, essentially, limited websites. They allow the pages and scripts end

            Our ability to manipulate and create webpages consistently across formats comes from

            The DOM is built to be language and platform independent so any software or programming language can use it
            to interface with documents. <br> It defines the interface methods and
            object types that represent elements of documents, the semantics and behavior of attributes
            of those objects, and also defines how they relate to one another. T

            UX is a broad umbrella term that can be divided up into four main disciplines: <br>Experience Strategy
            (ExS),
            Interaction Design (IxD), User Research (UR) and Information Architecture (IA).

            UX design is not just about the end user; it also brings huge value to the business providing the product or

            surveys,
            conduct interviews and usability testing, and create user personas in order to understand the end user’s
            needs and
            objectives. They gather both qualitative and quantitative data and use this to make good design decisions.

            User interface design is not the same as UX.
            UX is focused on the user’s journey to solve a problem; UI is focused on how a product’s surfaces look and
            function.<br>
            UX and UI go hand-in-hand, and the design of the product interface has a huge impact on the overall user

            client
            wants the user to process information on a site, based on the user research already performed by the UX
            design team.

            high-fidelity interactive prototypes which closely mimic the final product.<br>
            Testing your prototypes on real users helps to highlight any design flaws before you create the final
            product. Several rounds of testing could take place before the design is completely right. Once it is, the
            new product is finally ready to go into development.

            Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed
            to think like humans and mimic their actions. The term may also be applied to any machine that exhibits
            traits associated with a human mind such as learning and problem-solving.
            In general terms, AI refers to a broad
            field of science encompassing not only
            computer science but also psychology,
            philosophy, linguistics and other areas.

            Artificial Intelligence term was coined by

            Machine learning is the process whereby
            a computer distills meaning by exposure
            to training data. If for example you want
            an algorithm to identify spam in e-mails,
            you will have to train the algorithm by
            exposing it to many examples of e-mails
            that are manually labeled as being spam or
            not-spam. The algorithm “learns” to identify
            patterns, like occurrence of certain words
            or combination of words, that determines
            the chance of an e-mail being spam.
            Machine learning can be applied to many
            different problems and data sets.

            A chess computer could beat a human
            in playing chess, but it couldn’t solve a
            complex math problem. Virtually all current
            AI is “narrow”, meaning it can only do what
            it is designed for. This means for every
            problem, a specific algorithm needs to be
            designed to solve it. Narrow AI are mostly
            much better at the task they were made for
            than humans, like face recognition, chess
            computers, calculus, translation. The holy
            grail of AI is a General AI, a single system
            that can learn about any problem and then
            solve it. This is exactly what humans do:
            we can specialize in a specific topic, from
