              A fascinating exploration of how computer algorithms can be applied to our everyday lives, helping to
              solve common decision-making problems and illuminate the workings of the human mind.
              <br><br><br><strong>My Review:</strong>
              <br>
              Decision-making is one of the most critical functions of our mind. In this book, the authors clearly show
              how peoples' minds are programmed. The whole idea of algorithm design is about how our minds process and
              the steps we use to overcome challenges. Psychology explains how humans' minds operate when it comes to
              tasks that are difficult but common. We need to solve a problem once by finding the proper steps, remember
              them, and use them any time we face the same or similar problems. This idea is how computers work.
              Computers are programmed to make our life easier by completing tasks faster as a result of the combination
              of the power of the mind and the functionality of microprocessors that use with multiple levels of
              software. Authors go over the most crucial concepts of data structures and algorithms like searching,
              sorting, optimizing, graphs, etc., and show how such ideas were born.
              Although the literature is fairly simple, smooth, and does not include too many technical words and
              phrases, its concepts can be somehow difficult for readers with no or limited background in computer
              science and mathematics.

              Keep Working. Keep Playing. Keep Creating. This book shows you 10 ways to stay creative, focused, and true
              to yourself
              <br> <strong>My Review:</strong>
              <br>
              This book is designed creatively and presents some valuable but simple techniques for anyone who wants to
              be creative. The language of the book is simple, and the author used realistic examples to explain the
              concepts. He borrows a lot of interesting quotes from great scientists, artists, and thinkers. I recommend
              this book to everyone interested in the creation of arts, especially young artists.

              Humans of New York is a photoblog and book of street portraits and interviews collected on the streets of
              New York City.
              <br> <br><br><strong>My Review:</strong> <br>
              Amazing book for people who are interested in photography, especially street photography, and also the
              ones
              who
              like to read true stories about individuals with all the similarities and differences. New York City is
              the best location for street photography. It is one of the most diverse cities in the world with people
              from different cultures, social statuses, and nationalities.
              This book is an album full of colorful, exceptional, and artistic photos.
              Each person has a unique story to tell. Each photo captures a moment of that person's life, showing a
              specific feeling. Each photograph is associated with a caption and has a little story about the subject.
              Captions give you more, less, or no information about it.
              One of the most impactful lessons I learned from the author of this book is there is nothing better than
              humans for photography.

            <p class="job-description"> by Nathaniel
              Branden</a><br />
              <strong> My rating:</strong> <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3614702558">5 of 5
                stars</a><br /><br />
              The Six Pillars of Self-Esteem is a psychology book written by Dr. Nathaniel Branden. Dr. Branden is known
              as the "father" of the Self-Esteem movement and this book is his most popular work.
              <br> <br><br> <br> <strong>My Review:</strong> <br>
              Everybody should read this book, especially people with low self-esteem. Most psychological disorders such
              as depression, anxiety, and anger come from a lack of self-esteem. During a person's mental development,
              most babies between the age of one and three years old received millions of signals from other people
              regarding their weaknesses. Because children make mistakes and others correct them, they think they are
              bad. In the next stages of development, as what Piage introduced as the preoperational, concrete, and
              formal operational stages, the bad feeling of a child must be recovered by positive messages from parents,
              friends, and the educational system. Otherwise, the person could suffer from a low-esteem.
              In this book, Dr. Brandon provides a scientific and empirical method for building one's self-esteem as an
              adult.
