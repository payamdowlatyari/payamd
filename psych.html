              Let’s define psychology as the systematic study of behavior and experience.<br>
              The word experience lets us discuss your perceptions without implying that a mind exists independently of
              your body. The philosophical question of how experience relates to the brain is the mind-brain problem

            <p class="job-description">
              Dualism holds that the mind is separate from the brain but somehow controls the brain and therefore the
              rest of the body. However, dualism contradicts the law of conservation of matter and energy, one of the
              cornerstones of physics. According to that principle, the only way to influence any matter or energy,
              including the matter and energy that compose your body, is to act on it with other matter or energy.

              Researchers and philosophers favor monism, the view that conscious experience is inseparable from the
              physical brain. That is, mental activity is brain activity. So far as we can tell, consciousness cannot
              exist without brain activity. <br>
              Evidence supports monism: Every type of mental activity is associated with some type of measurable brain
              activity. Also, any type of brain damage leads to a deficit in some aspect of behavior or experience.

              well-being,
              a self-evaluation of one’s life as pleasant, interesting, satisfying, and meaningful.

            Short-term memory is also known as working memory. It holds only a few items (research shows a range of 7

            long-term memory via processes like rehearsal. <br>
            One way we are able to expand our ability to remember things in STM is by using a memory technique called

            Semantic memory is memory of principles and facts, like what you are taught in school. Episodic memory is

            Implicit memory refers to the influence of experience on behaviour, even if the individual is not aware of
            those influences. <br>
            There are three general types of implicit memory: procedural memory, classical conditioning effects, and
            priming. <br>
            Procedural memory refers to our often unexplainable knowledge of how to do things. <br>
            A second type of implicit memory is classical conditioning effects, in which we learn, often without effort
            or awareness, to associate neutral stimuli (such as a sound or a light) with another stimulus (such as
            food), which creates a naturally occurring response, such as enjoyment or salivation. <br>
            The final type of implicit memory is known as priming, or changes in behaviour as a result of experiences
            that have happened frequently or recently.

            Motivation is the process that initiates, guides, and maintains goal-oriented behaviors. It is what causes

            Different types of motivation are frequently described as being either extrinsic or intrinsic: <br>

            Extrinsic motivations are those that arise from outside of the individual and often involve rewards such as
            trophies, money, social recognition, or praise.<br>
            Intrinsic motivations are those that arise from within the individual, such as doing a complicated crossword
            puzzle purely for the personal gratification of solving a problem.

            Psychologists measure emotions by self-reports, behavioral observations, and physiological measures.
            People rate their happiness or other emotions by comparison to how they usually feel, not in comparison to
            how others feel. <br>

            To measure emotion, researchers measure sympathetic nervous system arousal as indicated by heart rate,
            breathing rate, or momentary changes in the electrical conductivity across the skin. Physiological
            measurements do not tell us which emotion someone is feeling.

            This model suggests that emotions are distributed in a two-dimensional circular space, containing arousal

            Anxiety is an increase in the startle reflex. The startle reflex is the quick, automatic response that
            follows a sudden loud noise. The startle reflex itself is automatic, but experiences and context modify it.

          <p class="job-description">

            Psychodynamic theory, also known as psychoanalytic psychotherapy, helps clients understand their emotions
            and unconscious patterns of behavior. <br>
            Freud referred to his method of explaining and dealing with personality, based on the interplay of conscious
            and unconscious forces, as psychoanalysis. <br>
            The greatest criticism of the psychodynamic approach is that it is unscientific in its analysis of human
            behavior. Many of the concepts central to Freud's theories are subjective, and as such, difficult to test
            scientifically.

          <p class="job-description">

            Freud delineated the mind in the distinct levels, each with their own roles and functions.<br>

            The preconscious consists of anything that could potentially be brought into the conscious mind.<br>
            The conscious mind contains all of the thoughts, memories, feelings, and wishes of which we are aware at any
            given moment. This is the aspect of our mental processing that we can think and talk about rationally. This
            also includes our memory, which is not always part of consciousness but can be retrieved easily and brought
            into awareness.<br>
            The unconscious mind is a reservoir of feelings, thoughts, urges, and memories that are outside of our
            conscious awareness. The unconscious contains contents that are unacceptable or unpleasant, such as feelings
            of pain, anxiety, or conflict.

          <p class="job-description">
            According to Freud, people have a psychosexual energy, which he called libido, from a Latin word meaning
            “desire.” During infancy, libido is focused in the mouth. As the child grows older, libido flows to other
            body parts. Children go through five stages of psychosexual development, and each leaves its mark on the
            adult personality. If normal sexual development is blocked or frustrated at any stage, Freud said, part of
            the libido is held in fixation at that stage, and the person continues to be preoccupied with the pleasure
            area associated with that stage.

            planning. According to Piaget, children reach the stage of formal operations at about age 11. Later
            researchers found that many people reach this stage later or not at all. <br>
            As adolescents enter this stage, they gain the ability to think in an abstract manner by manipulating ideas
            in their head, without any dependence on concrete manipulation

          <p class="job-description">
            Attachment is the emotional bond that forms between infant and caregiver, and it is the means by which the
            helpless infant gets primary needs met. It then becomes an engine of subsequent social, emotional, and
            cognitive development.

          <p class="job-description">
            A dictionary might define consciousness as the subjective experience of perceiving oneself and one’s
            surroundings.<br>
            In psychology, consciousness refers to your individual awareness of your unique thoughts, memories,
            feelings, sensations,
            and environments. Essentially, your consciousness is your awareness of yourself and the world around you.

          <p class="job-description">
            In a coma, the brain shows a steady but low level of activity
            and no response to any stimulus, including potentially painful stimuli. In nearly all cases, someone in a
            coma either dies or begins to recover within a few weeks. <br>
            Someone starting to emerge from a coma enters a vegetative state, marked by limited responsiveness, such as
            increased heart rate in response to pain. <br>
            The next step up is a minimally conscious state, in which people have brief periods of purposeful actions
            and speech comprehension. A vegetative or minimally conscious state can last for months or years.

          <p class="job-description">
            A stage of sleep called paradoxical sleep, or rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. During this stage of sleep,
            the sleeper’s eyes move rapidly back and forth under the closed lids. <br>
            William Dement’s early research indicated that people who were awakened during REM sleep usually reported
            dreaming, but people who were awakened during other periods seldom reported dreaming. REM dreams are on
            average longer, more complicated, and more visual, with more action by the dreamer, but not always.

          <p class="job-description">
            Sleep and dreams are not a state of unconsciousness but a state of reduced or altered consciousness.
            Each dream has a manifest content—the content that appears on the surface—and a latent content—the hidden
            ideas that the dream experience represents symbolically.

          <p class="job-description">
            Hypnosis is a condition of focused attention and increased suggestibility that occurs in the context of a
            special hypnotist–subject relationship. The term hypnosis comes from Hypnos, the Greek god of sleep,
            although the similarity between hypnosis and sleep is superficial.

          <p class="job-description">
            Meditation, a systematic procedure for inducing a calm, relaxed state through the use of special techniques,
            follows traditions that have been practiced in much of the world for thousands of years, especially in
            India. One variety of meditation seeks “mindfulness” or thoughtless awareness, in which the person is aware
            of the sensations of the moment but otherwise passive.
