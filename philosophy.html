            <p class="job-description">
              Philosophy is an activity: it is a way of thinking about certain sorts
              of question. Its most distinctive feature is its use of logical argument. <br>
              Philosophers typically deal in arguments: they either invent them,
              criticize other people’s, or do both. They also analyse and clarify
              concepts. <br> The word ‘philosophy’ is often used in a much broader
              sense than this to mean one’s general outlook on life, or else to
              refer to some forms of mysticism. <br>
              If you look in the dictionary you will discover that the term philosophy is derived from two Greek words
              that mean “the love of wisdom.” Philosophy, then, has
              something to do with wisdom, but wisdom is also a term that a lot of people use
              without knowing exactly what they mean by it. When the ancient Greek thinkers
              referred to wisdom, they usually meant the knowledge of fundamental principles
              and laws, an awareness of that which was basic and unchanging, as opposed to
              those things that are transitory and changing. Ever since then, the term philosophy
              has taken on something of this meaning and refers to attempts on the part of serious thinkers to get at
              the basis of things. Not the superficial, trivial details, but the
              underlying fundamentals.

              Since the time of Socrates there have been many great philosophers. <br> The history of philosophy is a
              fascinating and important
              subject in its own right, and many of the classic philosophical texts
              are also great works of literature: Plato’s Socratic dialogues, René
              Descartes’s Meditations, David Hume’s Enquiry Concerning Human
              Understanding, and Friedrich Nietzsche’s Thus Spake Zarathustra, to
              take just a few examples, all stand out as compelling pieces of writing
              by any standards.

              We humans are very prone to suffer from a psychological predicament we might call “the

              shipwreck, we tend to latch on to something for a sense of safety. We might cling to a

            <p class="job-description">
              The primary value of philosophy according to Russell is that it loosens the grip of uncritically
              held opinion and opens the mind to a liberating range of new possibilities to explore.
              <br>
              Bertrand Reussel states,
              "... It greatly increases our knowledge as to what they may be; it removes the
              somewhat arrogant dogmatism of those who have never traveled into the region of
              liberating doubt, and it keeps alive our sense of wonder by showing familiar things in an
              unfamiliar aspect".

              It is not uncontentious to say that philosophical problems are timeless. To some it looks like an excuse
              for examining problems which in fact can have no answer because thereis something wrong in considering
              them as ‘problems’ in the first place. However, thesubject of philosophy certainly acts as if
              philosophical problems are timeless.

            <h3 class="mb-0">Truth</h3>
            <p class="job-description">
              It’s natural to think that science and philosophy are mainly
              concerned with getting at the truth about things. There are two main questions about truth. It’s important
              to keep these two questions separate <br>
              What is it for a claim to be true?
              How do we determine that a claim is true? <br>
              Questions about how we know whether
              something is true are epistemic questions. But the question of what it is for something to be true
              is not an epistemic issue. The truth of a claim is quite independent of how or whether we know it
              to be true. <br>
              The ordinary everyday notion of truth would have it
              that a claim is true if the world is the way the claim says it is. If how
              my claim represents the world fits with the way the world is, then my claim is true.

            <h3 class="mb-0">Is Truth Relative to Meaning?</h3>
            <p class="job-description">
              Words and sentences can be used in lots of different ways. Even if we are not being
              inventive with language, there is lots of vagueness and ambiguity built into natural language. A
              tempting pitfall in thinking about truth is to think that truth is somehow relative to meaning or
              open to interpretation. <br>
              Our notion of truth is fundamentally about the
              correspondence between what is meant by a sentence and the way the world is. Philosophers
              often refer to what is meant or expressed by a sentence as a proposition. <br>
              The proposition does not have a meaning. Rather the proposition is what is meant. For a bit
              of language to be open to interpretation is for us to be able to attach different meanings to it. But
              the meanings themselves are not open to further interpretation. And it is the proposition, what is
              meant by the sentence, that is the fundamental bearer of truth or falsity. A proposition is true
              when it represents things the way they are.
              Getting clear on just what an argument says is critical to the
              dialectical process. <br> In other words,<br>
              - We use sentences, bits of language, to express propositions.<br>
              - The proposition, what is meant by the sentence, represents the world as being some way.<br>
              - The proposition is true when it represents the world in a way that corresponds to how the
              world is.<br>
              - Truth, understood as correspondence between a claim (a proposition) and the way the
              world is, is not relative to meaning, knowledge, belief, or opinion.

              Metaphysical issues are concerned with the nature of reality. Traditional metaphysical issues
              include the existence of God and the nature of human free will (assuming we have any). Here are
              a few metaphysical questions of interest to contemporary philosophers: What is a thing? How are
              space and time related? Does the past exist? How about the future? How many dimensions does
              the world have? Are there any entities beyond physical objects (like numbers, properties, and
              relations)? If so, how are they related to physical objects?

            <p class="job-description">

              Epistemology is concerned with the nature of knowledge and justified belief. What is
              knowledge? Can we have any knowledge at all? Can we have knowledge about the laws of
              nature, the laws or morality, or the existence of other minds? The view that we can’t have
              knowledge is called skepticism. An extreme form of skepticism denies that we can have any
              knowledge whatsoever. But we might grant that we can have knowledge about some things and
              remain skeptics concerning other issues. Many people, for instance, are not skeptics about
              scientific knowledge, but are skeptics when it comes to knowledge of morality

              While epistemology is concerned with what we ought to believe and how we ought to reason,

              organize our communities. Sadly, it comes as a surprise to many new philosophy students that

            <p class="job-description">

              Philosophy is not usually concerned with gathering facts. The reason for this is twofold. First,
              philosophy
              usually deals with matters that have to be assumed in gathering the facts – questions about truth and
              the knowability of reality, for example. Any attempt to solve the philosophical problems by reference
              to the facts is therefore highly likely to be question begging.
              We cannot for example refer to the evidence gathered through perception about the world to solve the
              philosophical problem of what can be known, if anything, about the world throughperception. Second,
              the facts are usually insufﬁcient to deal with the philosophical problem.

              It may seem strange to call philosophy done in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries‘modern

              doing
              philosophy that was a signiﬁcant break from what had gone before.Moreover many of the ways that

              What kind of entity are we referring to when we talk about the ‘mind’? How does talk of themind relate
              to talk of what we normally call our bodies? Are the mind and the body one oris the mind non-physical?
              How can conscious awareness and understanding whereby we referto things arise from inert matter? What
              do we mean by, and can it justify, saying that someoneis the same person throughout his life?

              What is it for an expression, spoken or written, to have meaning and the capacity to refer tothings?

              to be used correctly?
