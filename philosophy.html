            <p class="job-description">
              If you look in the dictionary you will discover that the term philosophy is derived from two Greek words
              that mean “the love of wisdom.” Philosophy, then, has
              something to do with wisdom, but wisdom is also a term that a lot of people use
              without knowing exactly what they mean by it. <br>
              When the ancient Greek thinkers
              referred to wisdom, they usually meant the knowledge of fundamental principles
              and laws, an awareness of that which was basic and unchanging, as opposed to
              those things that are transitory and changing. Ever since then, the term philosophy
              has taken on something of this meaning and refers to attempts on the part of serious thinkers to get at
              the basis of things. Not the superficial, trivial details, but the
              underlying fundamentals. <br>
              Philosophers typically deal in arguments. They either invent them,
              criticize other people’s, or do both. They also analyse and clarify
              concepts. <br>

            <p class="job-description">
              Since the time of Socrates there have been many great philosophers. The history of philosophy is a
              fascinating and important
              subject in its own right, and many of the classic philosophical texts
              are also great works of literature. <br> Plato’s Socratic dialogues, René
              Descartes’s Meditations, David Hume’s Enquiry Concerning Human
              Understanding, and Friedrich Nietzsche’s Thus Spake Zarathustra, to
              take just a few examples, all stand out as compelling pieces of writing
              by any standards.

            <p class="job-description">
              Philosophy is what happens when you start thinking for yourself.
              Once one frees oneself from the habits of received belief, those that one
              just happens to have acquired even about basic issues, and really starts to think about what one ought to
              believe, judged by reason (argument) and evidence, then one has started to do philosophy.

              We humans are very prone to suffer from a psychological predicament we might call “the
              security blanket paradox.” We know the world is full of hazards, and like passengers after a
              shipwreck, we tend to latch on to something for a sense of safety. We might cling to a
              possession, another person, our cherished beliefs, or any combination of these.

            <p class="job-description">
              The primary value of philosophy according to Russell is that it loosens the grip of uncritically
              held opinion and opens the mind to a liberating range of new possibilities to explore.
              <br>
              Bertrand Reussel states,
              "It greatly increases our knowledge as to what they may be; it removes the
              somewhat arrogant dogmatism of those who have never traveled into the region of
              liberating doubt, and it keeps alive our sense of wonder by showing familiar things in an
              unfamiliar aspect".

              It is not uncontentious to say that philosophical problems are timeless. To some it looks like an excuse
              for examining problems which in fact can have no answer because thereis something wrong in considering
              them as ‘problems’ in the first place. However, the subject of philosophy certainly acts as if
              philosophical problems are timeless.

            <p class="job-description">
              Metaphysical issues are concerned with the nature of reality. Traditional metaphysical issues
              include the existence of God and the nature of human free will (assuming we have any). Here are
              a few metaphysical questions of interest to contemporary philosophers: What is a thing? How are
              space and time related? Does the past exist? How about the future? How many dimensions does
              the world have? Are there any entities beyond physical objects (like numbers, properties, and
              relations)? If so, how are they related to physical objects?

              Epistemology is concerned with the nature of knowledge and justified belief. <br> What is
              knowledge? <br> Can we have any knowledge at all? <br> Can we have knowledge about the laws of
              nature, the laws or morality, or the existence of other minds? <br> The view that we can’t have
              knowledge is called skepticism. An extreme form of skepticism denies that we can have any
              knowledge whatsoever. But we might grant that we can have knowledge about some things and
              remain skeptics concerning other issues. Many people, for instance, are not skeptics about
              scientific knowledge, but are skeptics when it comes to knowledge of morality.

            <h3 class="mb-0">Beyond The Factual </h3>
            <p class="job-description">
              Philosophy is not usually concerned with gathering facts.
              The reason for this is twofold. First,
              philosophy
              usually deals with matters that have to be assumed in gathering the facts – questions about truth and
              the know ability of reality, for example. Any attempt to solve the philosophical problems by reference
              to the facts is therefore highly likely to be question begging.
              We cannot for example refer to the evidence gathered through perception about the world to solve the
              philosophical problem of what can be known, if anything, about the world through perception. Second,
              the facts are usually insufﬁcient to deal with the philosophical problem.

              This is the study of the philosophers of the Greek and Roman world. The usual concentrationis on Greek
              philosophy from

              624
              BC
              , marking the birth of the Presocratic Thales, to 322
              BC
              as the death of Aristotle. The most important ﬁgures are undoubtedly Plato and Aristotle. Often this
              period is extended to include the Roman world. The signiﬁcance of thought in theancient world cannot
              be overestimated. Here we ﬁnd almost everything, developed to varying degrees, that characterises the
              Western outlook. Indeed it represents a watershed in human history, where for the ﬁrst time reason
              alone is applied across the board to the solving of the deepest problems rather than appeal to mere
              authority or an idea’s longevity.

              This covers, we should note, the study of philosophers over a vast time of around one thousand years,
              extending from St Augustine of Hippo (
              354–430) and William of Ockham(
              1285–1349), and continuing beyond until at least the Renaissance. The connecting thread is the rise
              and dominance of Christianity which permeates the philosophy done during this period. The other most
              significant link throughout the period is the interpretation andadaptation of Aristotle’s metaphysics.

              It may seem strange to call philosophy done in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries ‘modern

              doing
              philosophy that was a signiﬁcant break from what had gone before. Moreover many of the ways that

            <p class="job-description">
              It’s natural to think that science and philosophy are mainly
              concerned with getting at the truth about things. There are two main questions about truth. It’s important
              to keep these two questions separate <br>
              What is it for a claim to be true?
              How do we determine that a claim is true? <br>
              Questions about how we know whether
              something is true are epistemic questions. But the question of what it is for something to be true
              is not an epistemic issue. The truth of a claim is quite independent of how or whether we know it
              to be true. <br>
              The ordinary everyday notion of truth would have it
              that a claim is true if the world is the way the claim says it is. If how
              my claim represents the world fits with the way the world is, then my claim is true.

            <h3 class="mb-0">Is Truth Relative to Meaning?</h3>
            <p class="job-description">
              Words and sentences can be used in lots of different ways. Even if we are not being
              inventive with language, there is lots of vagueness and ambiguity built into natural language. A
              tempting pitfall in thinking about truth is to think that truth is somehow relative to meaning or
              open to interpretation. <br>
              Our notion of truth is fundamentally about the
              correspondence between what is meant by a sentence and the way the world is. Philosophers
              often refer to what is meant or expressed by a sentence as a proposition. <br>
              The proposition does not have a meaning. Rather the proposition is what is meant. For a bit
              of language to be open to interpretation is for us to be able to attach different meanings to it. But
              the meanings themselves are not open to further interpretation. And it is the proposition, what is
              meant by the sentence, that is the fundamental bearer of truth or falsity. A proposition is true
              when it represents things the way they are.
              Getting clear on just what an argument says is critical to the
              dialectical process. <br><br> In other words,<br>
              - We use sentences, bits of language, to express propositions.<br>
              - The proposition, what is meant by the sentence, represents the world as being some way.<br>
              - The proposition is true when it represents the world in a way that corresponds to how the
              world is.<br>
              - Truth, understood as correspondence between a claim (a proposition) and the way the
              world is, is not relative to meaning, knowledge, belief, or opinion.

            <p class="job-description">
              An
              argument results when a group of statements, called premises, is said to lead to another
              statement, referred to as the conclusion. The relationship between premises and a conclusion can be
              described in various ways, but in general we can say that the premises
              support the truth of the conclusion, ideally (in deductive arguments) entailing or necessitating the
              conclusion, but at least (in inductive arguments) showing the conclusion most
              likely to be true.

            <h3 class="mb-0"> Validity</h3>
            <p class="job-description">
              Arguments can go wrong and lead us to errors
              in two different ways. The first way is when the statements in the argument are false. The
              second way is when the relationship between the premises and conclusion is such that
              the conclusion is not entailed by the premises. When the conclusion does not follow from
              the premises, we say that the argument is invalid. When we can show that the premises do
              lead to the conclusion, we say that the argument is valid. As logicians use the term, only
              arguments can be valid or invalid. The statements in an argument are either true or false,
              but are never valid or invalid.<br>
              An argument can be valid, yet contain false propositions, as in the following example:<br><br>
              All spiders have six legs.<br>
              All six-legged creatures have wings.<br>
              Therefore, all spiders have wings. <br><br>
              Clearly, all spiders do not have wings. The argument is valid, however, because if
              the premises were true, the conclusion would follow. So, we can add to our definition
              of validity the following condition. A valid argument is one in which, if the premises are
              true, the conclusion must be true.

              Arguments vary greatly in their relative strengths. Some arguments are so strong
              that the conclusion could not possibly be false if the premises themselves are all
              true. These are known as deductive arguments, and they prove the conclusion
              conclusively. A valid deductive argument is one in which, if the premises are true, the

            <p class="job-description">
              In the vast
              majority of arguments in the natural sciences and in such social sciences as psychology, geography,
              history, linguistics, and anthropology, one finds that the reasons lend
              weight to the conclusion without demonstrating conclusively the truth of these conclusions. These
              arguments are called inductive arguments, a type of reasoning that has been
              a source of great perplexity to philosophers. An inductive argument is one in which the
              premises, if true, make the conclusion probable, or likely to be true, and therefore make
              it reasonable to accept the conclusion. Inductive arguments are, however, neither valid nor invalid, since
              they do not
              prove or fail to prove their conclusion absolutely.

              2. Show how, on your opponent’s premises, an absurdity results. <br>
              3. Conclude that, since your opponent’s view leads to absurdity, his or her view must
              be mistaken, and your view, which is the opposite, is therefore correct.

            <h3 class="mb-0">Some Common Fallacies </h3>
            <p class="job-description">
              Argumentum ad Baculum <br>
              The argumentum ad baculum fallacy is an appeal to force as the basis for accepting or
              rejecting a point of view. It is committed whenever a proposition is said to be true because those in
              positions of power say it is. <br> <br>
              Ad Hominem Attack <br>
              The ad hominem fallacy is committed when an author attempts to refute another author’s
              position by attacking the person rather than the argument. <br> <br>
              Argument from Ignorance <br>
              The argument from ignorance fallacy is committed whenever it is argued that a proposition is true because
              it has not been proved false, or a certain proposition is false because
              it has not been proved true. This fallacy often occurs in situations in which there exists
              little evidence either for or against a position. <br> <br>
              Appeal to Pity <br>
              The appeal to pity occurs when a writer makes an appeal to pity in order to get a position accepted. This
              fallacy often occurs in law courts when a defense attorney will plead
              for the acquittal of the defendant by appealing to the pity of the jurors. <br> <br>
              Appeal to Authority <br>
              The appeal to authority is a little more tricky than the appeal to pity. It occurs when an
              author appeals to the testimony of an authority in matters outside that authority’s realm
              of specialization. <br> <br>
              Hasty Generalization <br>
              Hasty generalization occurs when an author cites an example that is not typical in order to
              make a general point covering all cases. Often it is argued that marijuana should be legal
              because in some cases it is valuable in treating illnesses. <br> <br>
              Argumentum ad Populum <br>
              A favorite device of the propagandist and the advertiser, the argumentum ad populum
              occurs when one attempts to win popular assent to a conclusion by arousing enthusiasm
              in the masses or appealing to emotional issues of patriotism, motherhood, or decency,
              rather than by appealing to facts. <br> <br>
              Begging the Question <br>
              Begging the question, which we came across earlier, occurs whenever a person assumes
              what the argument is trying to prove. <br> <br>
              Complex Question <br>
              Complex question is the familiar double or loaded question, such as “Have you stopped
              beating your wife?” Here the stated question presupposes an affirmative answer to an unasked question.
              <br> <br>
              Equivocation <br>
              This fallacy occurs whenever an argument turns on a crucial shift in the meaning
              of a significant word or phrase. A famous example is attributed by G. E. Moore to
              John Stuart Mill’s argument for ethical utilitarianism, in which Mill argues that the
              only proof possible that something is desirable is that people actually desire it. <br> <br>
              Red Herring <br>
              Red herring is the fallacy of sidetracking the argument from the issue under consideration
              to a completely different issue. Usually, this occurs when the central question at issue is
              problematic or doubtful and the red herring issue is one readily agreed to by all sides. <br> <br>
              Straw Man<br>
              The straw man is the fallacy of substituting for your opponent’s position a simplistic
              caricature. By defeating the caricature (the straw man), the fallacious impression is created that you
              have defeated your opponent’s position
