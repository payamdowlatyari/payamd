          <p class="job-description">
            Asymptotic notations are the mathematical notations used to describe the running time of an algorithm when
            the input tends towards a particular value or a limiting value.<br>
            There are mainly three asymptotic notations:<br>

            Big-O notation: represents the upper bound of the running time of an algorithm. Thus, it gives the
            worst-case complexity of an algorithm. <br>
            Omega notation: represents the lower bound of the running time of an algorithm. Thus, it provides the best
            case complexity of an algorithm. <br>
            Theta notation: encloses the function from above and below. Since it represents the upper and the lower
            bound of the running time of an algorithm, it is used for analyzing the average-case complexity of an
            algorithm.

            3. Combine: Combine the solutions of the sub-problems that are part of the recursive process to solve the
            actual problem.

            A stack is a useful data structure in programming. It is just like a pile of plates kept on top of each

            Such an arrangement is called Last In First Out - the last item that is the first item to go out.<br>
            In programming terms, putting an item on top of the stack is called push and removing an item is called
            pop.

            A queue is a useful data structure in programming. It is similar to the ticket queue outside a cinema hall.
            <br>
            Queue follows the First In First Out (FIFO) rule - the item that goes in first is the item that comes out
            first.<br>
            In programming terms, putting items in the queue is called enqueue, and removing items from the queue is
            called dequeue.<br>
            There are four different types of queues:<br>
            - Simple Queue<br>

            Sequential:
            As far as possible, complete each process step before beginning the
            next. Waterfall model. <br>
            Iterative:
            Go quickly through all process steps to create a rough system, then
            repeat them to improve the system. Iterative refinement.<br>
            Incremental:
            An variant of iterative refinement in which small increments of so(ware
            are placed in production (sprints). Agile development.

            Emphasis: <br>
            • producing small increments of software in a reasonably short time frame <br>
            • Entire process is run during a sprint <br>
            • Sprint results are deployed <br>

            Antithesis of Waterfall: <br>
            • Plans develop incrementally and evolve <br>
            • Client collaboration versus client negotiation <br>
            • Specification follows from working system, not the reverse <br>
            • Immediate feedback from deployment <br>
            • Responding to change rather than following a plan <br>
            • Enhancements, new features, and bug fix are all prioritized as candidates for focus
            during next sprint <br>
            • Emphasis on keeping scope small <br>
            • Although the impact of changes will grow over time

            Emphasis on small, semi-independent teams ideally delivering discrete pieces of a system <br>

            Leads to devOps models<br>
            1. Team
            • Small, cross-functional, self-organizing units <br>
            2. Scope
            • Small deliverable scope delivered in consensus priority order
            • Priorities can be adjusted (typically at sprint start) <br>
            3. Timeline
            • Small iterations (2-3 weeks is typical) emphasizing delivery at the end
